We are currently few developers actively contributing to the project. Feel free to reach out to us for any help.

The technology stack used in this framework is described below.

### Bare Essentials 

**Git** - You guessed it right, we use git for our code versioning following the [git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) suggested by Vincent.

**CoffeeScript** - For cleaner code, we have adopted [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org). Please use the below resources to familiarise yourselves.

**Jade** - For HTML, we use jade templating engine.

**AngularJS** - JavaScript framework that we employ. Very elegant. [Official website](https://angularjs.org/) has the best documentation.

**[WebPack](https://webpack.github.io/)** - module bundler. 

### Optional

**[D3](http://d3js.org)** - Data driven charts
